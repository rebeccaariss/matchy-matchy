# matchy matchy

âœ¨ A minimalist and nostalgic card-matching game featuring some of my favourite emojis ðŸ‘¾ âœ¨

### Progress Tracking

Breaking down the process (with pictures!)

#### September 11:

1. From an array of `emojis`, created and styled 12 starter cards.
2. Added click handler function calls to each card.
3. For every 2 clicks, 1 turn is taken (2 clicks will eventually represent either matched or mismatched cards). The click handler updates state values (`move` and `turns`) depending on how many times the user has clicked cards.
4. Turns are displayed via state logic beneath the cards.
